# Project 2: DocuDive

### Overview
==================================

For my  second project at WDI General Assembly I have created a website to be used by dive enthusiasts where they can share their recent dive experiences, the location of their dive and provide a small review.   Please see direct link to Heroku below.

### Project Brief
==================================

Your app must:

- Have at least 2 models â€“ one representing a user and one that represents the main resource of your app, e.g. Restaurants
- Incude relationships - embedded or referenced. Make sure you take the time to consider the best approach before building out your models.
- The app should include authentication - with hashed passwords & an authorization flow.
- Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with all CRUD actions.
- You must use SCSS - as this is a key industry skill.
- You should use a CSS framework that has a grid system - even if the grid is the only part you use from the framework, it is fundamental that you get to grips with rows and columns.
- Include wireframes - that you designed before building the app.
- Have semantically clean HTML - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public.

### Challenges and Problems

- It was challenging at first to figure out the step-by-step process of building the app and inputting this into my Trello  board.
- Connecting to the Google Maps API
- Implementing the search bar to perform dual searches of location and rating simultaneously

---

### Wins

- At the beginning of each day I would plan out my goals and try to hit my targets for the day. This way, I was able to keep to a strict schedule.
- I am proud of all the functionality I have produced in the project as well as the styling.
- Connecting my app to the Google Maps API 

---

### Future Features

- Displaying all user dive coordinates on a single map
- Giving admin permissions to email addresses
- Add more filter capability to search function
- Link coordinates to a weather API to display current weather
- Link to a surfing API to show popular surfing spots
